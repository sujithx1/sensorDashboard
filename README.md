This project is a lightweight Industrial IoT dashboard built using React (TypeScript) for the frontend and Node.js with Express (TypeScript) for the backend. The backend simulates mock sensor data (temperature, vibration, voltage, and current) and exposes it through a simple REST API. The frontend fetches this data every 5 seconds, displays it in a styled dashboard, and uses toast notifications to alert the user when the machine status is either "Warning" or "Critical".

I implemented the status logic based on given conditions: when both temperature and vibration exceed safe levels, the status is marked as "Critical"; when either one exceeds, it's "Warning"; otherwise, it's "Healthy". I used react-toastify for alerts, axios for HTTP requests, and kept the UI clean and responsive using basic CSS. If this were to move toward production, Iâ€™d enhance error handling, loading states, and possibly add data persistence and live updates later on.
